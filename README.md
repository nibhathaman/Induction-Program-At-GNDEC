# Induction Program At GNDEC
# Day 1

Our induction program began on a serene and soulful note with Shabad Kirtan at the Gurudwara Sahib within the campus. The peaceful start created a sense of belonging and calmness, setting the right mood for the journey ahead.

Afterwards, we gathered in the auditorium where Ms. Taranpreet Kaur, one of our seniors, welcomed us warmly. She began by sharing that this year is a special one — the Platinum Jubilee of GNDEC. 
The session continued with Mr. Harsimran Singh, who told us about the college’s accreditations and various student societies. Soon after, the lights dimmed and the screen lit up with glimpses of GNDEC’s proud alumni. Their journeys, from sitting in the same auditorium seats as us to achieving remarkable milestones, were truly inspiring and made us believe that we, too, could walk such paths.

Later, Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal Mam , Head of the Applied Science Department, addressed us in a thoughtful session on how to glorify ourselves. She reassured us, sharing simple yet powerful ideas:
1. Life is a continuous function, always evolving.
2. Beginnings should be rooted in prayer, patience, persistence, perseverance, and above all, honesty.

*Her words reminded us that while skills and knowledge matter, it is honesty that shapes our character and guides us towards lasting success*.

Then Dr. Parminder Singh Sir (Deen Student Welfare) enlightened us with his valuable words. Our Principal Sir welcomed us to the GNDEC family and emphasized discipline, continuous learning, and making the most of opportunities. The day ended with the Chief Guest’s inspiring words, urging us to work with dedication and curiosity, leaving a memorable close to Day 1 of the induction program.*


# Day 2

In the afternoon, Dr. Arashdeep Singh delivered an enlightening session on the pivotal role of food in a student’s life. He explained how balanced nutrition plays a crucial part in maintaining physical health, mental sharpness, and overall academic performance, while also encouraging us to adopt mindful eating habits.

This was followed by an interactive session with our seniors, who introduced the Causmic Club — a platform for innovation, creativity, and collaborative learning. They also launched the induction activities, starting with the creation of a repository on GitHub, designed to strengthen our technical skills from the very beginning. The day ended on an enthusiastic note, motivating us to participate wholeheartedly in the upcoming programs.
